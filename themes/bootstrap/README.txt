Bootstrap theme for Drupal

1. Download the Bootstrap library v2 (http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/), make sure the resulting folder is named "bootstrap." If you are using the Github master branch, you will need to also find a way to compile the LESS and JS files since this module looks for bootstrap.css and bootstrap.js. 
2. Place the bootstrap folder inside the bootstrap theme folder or your subtheme folder: [path_to_themes]/bootstrap/bootstrap/jsâ€¦
3. Put any plugin files into [path_to_themes]/bootstrap/bootstrap/js/
4. Make sure you have jQuery 1.7, which is available through the jQuery Update module (http://drupal.org/project/jquery_update/) 7.x-2.x-dev version. You need to make sure the 1.7 version is selected on the configuration page for it to work.
